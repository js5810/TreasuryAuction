# TreasuryAuction 
The official TreasuryDirect website does not provide detailed data on the auctions for new and re-opened US treasury fixed income securities. It only gives the highest and lowest bids for the yield rate but leaves out important data such as the actual YTM produced by the auction. These important numbers are scattered throughout the website on interactive tables and PDF documents. This is a program that automatically gathers the latest auction results of US treasury bills, notes, and bonds and helps visualize the data. It will constantly check for any new auction data and will produce a visual report as soon as the most recent auction is posted on TreasuryDirect. The visualizations give an additonal way of looking at market participants' outlook on the spot rate which can be helpful to consider in conjunction with the yield curve.
