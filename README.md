# TreasuryAuction 
This is useful because:
* the official TreasuryDirect website does not readily provide detailed data on auctions for new and re-opened US debt securities
* only the highest and lowest bids for the yield rate are shown
* more important data such as the actual YTM determined by the auction are scattered throughout the website on interactive tables and PDF documents
* hard to quickly summarize the auction participants' outlook on spot interest rates

This program:
* automatically gathers the latest auction results of US treasury bills, notes, and bonds and creates useful visualizations
* constantly checks for any new auction data and will produce a visual report as soon as the most recent auction is posted

In short, the program taps into auctions as a new way of gauging market participants' outlook on interest rates which can be helpful to consider in conjunction with the actual yield curve.
